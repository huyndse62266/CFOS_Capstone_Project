2.	<b>Problem Abstract </b><br/>
This project aims to reimagine food-courts that can be found in most shopping centers. In the traditional setup, a food-court consists of a common dining area filled with tables and chairs, and an array of “restaurants” serving various kinds of dishes. Each restaurant has its own order counter with at least one counter staff equipped with a POS machine for taking and managing orders. 
The new design in this project will eliminate the need for separate counters, or any counter at all. Instead, there will a series of ordering terminals with touch screens on which customers can navigate the menus, choose dishes and related options, and make payment using printed QR code when order. 
The orders will then be diverted to the right restaurants where they will be fulfilled by their kitchen staffs. The foods, once ready, are tagged with order number so they can be picked up by the appropriate customers. Customers can also quickly order food through the phone application and make payment using the balance available in their account.<br/><br/>
